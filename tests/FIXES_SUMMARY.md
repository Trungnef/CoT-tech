# LLM Evaluation System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Reentrant Call Issues in Logging Setup**
   - Fixed potential deadlocks when multiple threads try to initialize logging simultaneously
   - Added proper handling for reentrant calls to `setup_logging`
   - Implemented double-check locking pattern in `get_logger`

2. **Enhanced Retry Mechanism for HTTP Errors**
   - Improved error detection for 502 Bad Gateway and 429 Too Many Requests
   - Added better status code extraction from various exception types
   - Enhanced retry backoff strategy with proper jitter
   - Added support for Retry-After headers

## Files Modified

### 1. `llm_evaluation/utils/logging_setup.py`
- Added initialization state tracking flag (`_is_initializing`)
- Improved locking mechanism to prevent deadlocks
- Added fallback to temporary logger during initialization
- Added try/finally block to ensure initialization flag is reset

### 2. `llm_evaluation/core/model_interface.py`
- Enhanced `should_retry_exception` function to:
  - Better detect HTTP status codes from different exception types
  - Always retry on connection and timeout errors
  - Specifically handle 429, 502, 503, and 504 status codes
  - Improve error message pattern matching
  - Skip retry for authentication and validation errors (400, 401, 403, 404, 422)

- Improved `wait_with_jitter` function to:
  - Implement proper exponential backoff with random jitter
  - Support Retry-After headers in both seconds and HTTP date formats
  - Add better logging of retry attempts
  - Cap maximum delay to prevent excessive waiting

## Test Files Created

1. `logging_test.py`
   - Tests concurrent logger initialization from multiple threads
   - Tests reentrant logger calls

2. `retry_test.py`
   - Tests the should_retry_exception function for different error types
   - Tests the wait_with_jitter function's exponential backoff behavior
   - Tests Retry-After header handling

3. `api_retry_test.py`
   - Simulates API calls with common error scenarios (429, 502, 500, 503, connection errors)
   - Tests the end-to-end retry mechanism
   - Verifies proper backoff and retry behavior

## How to Test

1. Run the logging test:
   ```
   python logging_test.py
   ```

2. Run the retry function test:
   ```
   python retry_test.py
   ```

3. Run the simulated API test:
   ```
   python api_retry_test.py
   ```

## Impact on Evaluation Process

These changes ensure:

1. **Thread Safety**: Multiple concurrent evaluations won't interfere with logging initialization
2. **Improved Error Handling**: Better handling of transient API errors, especially 429 and 502
3. **Optimized Retry Strategy**: Smart backoff strategy prevents overwhelming services during issues
4. **No Missed Evaluations**: Improved retry mechanism ensures no evaluations are missed due to temporary API errors

The logging and retry systems now work together to provide a robust evaluation process that can handle API rate limits and temporary service disruptions without losing data or requiring manual intervention.
